Application of Nature Inspired Intelligent Algorithms in Optimization Studies related to Nuclear Reactor - Report

ABSTRACT

With the rising complexity of problems, there is an increased demand for better algorithms to squeeze out the best possible performance out of the limited resources available for a problem. Researchers have long argued, primitive beings do some specific tasks in a highly efficient manner. Nature inspired algorithms aim to learn from their mannerisms to try and get better results. This project comprises of a comparative study between three modern metaheuristic techniques, namely, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization and on a multi-modal function, the Ackleyâ€™s function. In the second half of the project, a comparative study was carried out between Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization on the Fuel Bundle Burnup Optimization Problem of the Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR). This study sets a strong base on future work in the field of computational intelligence and optimization. This also gives future researchers a head start to try and combine two or more algorithms in hopes to get a better result than when executed individually.
